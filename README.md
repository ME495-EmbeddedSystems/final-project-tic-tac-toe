# ME 495 Final Project - Tic-Tac-Toe on Sawyer

## Overview
The simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe is typically played on a drawing board when a human versus another human or on a digital screen when it is human versus computer. This project seeks to allow a human to play against a computer on a dry erase board. To fulfill this objective, we programmed the Sawyer robot arm to execute three objectives: read the current board state, compute its next optimal move, and perform the trajectory needed to draw an X in that board space.
